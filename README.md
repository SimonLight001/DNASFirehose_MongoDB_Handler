# DNASFirehose_MongoDB_Handler

This file is designed to create a simple interface between DNA Spaces Firehose stream, and MongoDB Atlas.

For those of you who are using a .io domain, please make sure you manually change domains.
This will be something I will add in the future, that domain will be held as a single variable.

To use the application you will firstly need an API key from the DNA Spaces Firehose API (included with the DNA Spaces Extend Licenses).
Reach out to your Cisco account team if you need help getting this.
You will also need a connection to a MongoDB Atlas account.
You can find this by hitting "connect" on your DB, then "Connect your application".
This will give you a URL you need to call to.
Paste this in as CONNECTION_STRING

If you have any questions or need help using the script please reach out!
